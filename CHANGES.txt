-   Support for article drafts. A checkbox in the article editing view lets the
    user choose whether the article should be published. Drafts are not visible
    in the normal views. To edit them, an authorized user has to visit the correct
    URL to the edit view.
-   This release introduces support for PostgreSQL and drops support for MySQL.
-   Line endings of all kinds (CR/CRLF/LF) in articles are now normalized to the
    Unix standard (LF).

-   Minor software update. Major documentation update.
-   Tweaks related to the initial creation of the articles DB table, mostly
    for MySQL.
    * Default character set is explicitly set to 'utf8', since MySQL's system
      default charset is usually 'latin1'.
    * The publishing time of articles no longer changes when articles are re-saved.
-   Documentation! First editions of README and INSTALL have been created. There are
    some lies about how releases are packaged, which should be sorted out soon.
    HACKING has not yet been written.

-   Compatibility fix release. This is worthy of a new major version number simply
    because the last release didn't have a version number.
-   MySQL is now supported as the database backend as well as SQLite. Not that
    anyone will figure out how to use it since there is still no documentation
    or sample configuration files.
