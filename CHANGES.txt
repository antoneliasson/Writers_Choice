-  Compatibility fix release. This is worthy of a new major version number simply
   because the last release didn't have a version number.
-  MySQL is now supported as the database backend as well as SQLite. Not that
   anyone will figure out how to use it since there is still no documentation
   or sample configuration files.

     file may add and edit articles. Everyone can read.
