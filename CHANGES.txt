-   Still in beta!
-   URL redesign. Hopefully the first and the last. URL's were previously
    "/<magic id>/<article title slug>", like "/1/dear-diary". This had the
    advantage of a built-in URL shortener, because only the ID was significant
    (the title could be omitted). Not that anyone had ever asked for a built-in
    URL shortener, I later realized. I was never really happy with this style
    because:
        1. Web apps should try really hard to have URL's containing only
           information that is meaningful to the user.
        2. ID's might change in the future if I encounter a database that does
           not let me choose my ID's arbitrarily, forcing me to create a mapper
           just to retain my silly URL's.
        3. It's usually really neat to have the publication date in the URL in a
           blog-like website. I should do that too!
    So, now they look like "/<year>/<month>/<day>/<article title slug>",
    according to W3C's recommendations from 1998 [1]. Slightly longer and a bit
    less robust (people will actually have to type them in verbatim,
    non-truncated). As a (not so unintended) side-effect, this new design lays
    the foundation for monthly/yearly article archives, like "</year>/<month>/"
    (with a trailing slash).

-   Support for article drafts. A checkbox in the article editing view lets the
    user choose whether the article should be published. Drafts are not visible
    in the normal views. To edit them, an authorized user has to visit the correct
    URL to the edit view.
-   This release introduces support for PostgreSQL and drops support for MySQL.
-   Line endings of all kinds (CR/CRLF/LF) in articles are now normalized to the
    Unix standard (LF).

-   2013-06-06
-   Minor software update. Major documentation update.
-   Tweaks related to the initial creation of the articles DB table, mostly
    for MySQL.
    * Default character set is explicitly set to 'utf8', since MySQL's system
      default charset is usually 'latin1'.
    * The publishing time of articles no longer changes when articles are re-saved.
-   Documentation! First editions of README and INSTALL have been created. There are
    some lies about how releases are packaged, which should be sorted out soon.
    HACKING has not yet been written.

-   2013-06-04
-   Compatibility fix release. This is worthy of a new major version number simply
    because the last release didn't have a version number.
-   MySQL is now supported as the database backend as well as SQLite. Not that
    anyone will figure out how to use it since there is still no documentation
    or sample configuration files.

-   2013-05-10
-   First release. A blog-like CMS has been born!
-   Features:
    * Reading articles
    * Adding articles
    * Editing articles
    * Authentication with Mozilla Persona. One user specified in the configuration
      file may add and edit articles. Everyone can read.
-   Stories 1-33 are implemented
-   Version numbers and other fancy metadata are not yet implemented, so this
    release has the default value '0.0'
