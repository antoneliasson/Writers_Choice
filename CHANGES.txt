-  2013-06-06
-  Minor software update. Major documentation update.
-  Tweaks related to the initial creation of the articles DB table, mostly
   for MySQL.
   * Default character set is explicitly set to 'utf8', since MySQL's system
     default charset is usually 'latin1'.
   * The publishing time of articles no longer changes when articles are re-saved.
-  Documentation! First editions of README and INSTALL have been created. There are
   some lies about how releases are packaged, which should be sorted out soon.
   HACKING has not yet been written.

-  Compatibility fix release. This is worthy of a new major version number simply
   because the last release didn't have a version number.
-  MySQL is now supported as the database backend as well as SQLite. Not that
   anyone will figure out how to use it since there is still no documentation
   or sample configuration files.
